# TankCapCircuitPoj
Calculating RMS voltage, RMS current trough the capacitors and maximal RMS current trough the capacitor tank group in an electrical circuit. Input values: generator RMS current [A], generator frequency [Hz], capacitor types, capacitor count.

This branch serves for additional work on the working project from the master branch.

If I continue this work I will:
  -> implement a solution for the last task: calculating the max RMS current through the tank capacitor group
  -> I will make the solution in more OOP style.
